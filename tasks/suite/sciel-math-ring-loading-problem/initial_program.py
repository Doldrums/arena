def ring_routing() -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Solve the SONET ring loading problem on a ring of n = 10 nodes with 10 edges,
    where a FIXED set of D = 15 demands must each be routed either clockwise or
    counter-clockwise around the ring. The goal is to choose a routing direction
    for every demand so as to MINIMIZE the maximum load over all 10 edges.

    Each entry of the returned array selects the direction for one demand:
        0 -> route the demand clockwise
        1 -> route the demand counter-clockwise

    Returns:
        routing: np.ndarray of shape (15,) with one 0/1 entry per demand.
